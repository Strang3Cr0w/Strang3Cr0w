                Are you looking for a cook? Most likely not. Are you looking for 
                financial advice? Probably not. Are you looking for someone who is motivated
                to learn, a self-starter, has great interpersonal skills, teamwork oriented, 
                a great problem-solver, and knowlegeable about the technologies surrounding
                software development? That's why you're here ain't it?

            Well look no further. My name is Edgar Garibay. My background is in the
            restaurant industry and in finance. It may not seem like a good fit, but 
            many of the skills I've learned as a leader and working within a team are
            quite applicable to coding in general. I'm a self taught coder with extensive
            knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm also familiar with PostgreSQL, Python
            and C++. Allow me to join your team so I may grow as a software engineer and help
            you achieve your goals.
        </p>
